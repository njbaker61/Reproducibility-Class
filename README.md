# Reproducibility Project: The *Chrysobothris femorata* Complex in Alabama: Species, Flight Period, and Factors Affecting Host Choice

### The main purpose of this class was to create a reproducible workflow of my Master's research project. My project, as well as the contents of this repository,
are described below.

Beetles in the genus *Chrysobothris* are common ornamental tree, fruit, and nut pests across the southeastern US. 
Unlike other pest borers, like the Emerald Ash Borer, individuals beloning to the genus *Chrysobothris* are poorly understood with respect to phenology and distribution. 
Additionally, these borers remain taxonomically unresolved, and identification to species can be extremely difficult (especially without male genitalia).

#### The main goals of this project are to:

1. Trap *Chrysobothris* species across three different locations in Alabama (Mobile, Auburn, Alpine)
2. Identify all trapped individuals to sex and species
3. Begin to describe *Chrysobothris* phenology across Alabama based on dates of collection
4. Investigate visual cues associated with host choice by constructing traps that mimic tree trunks of different diameters

**Due to extremely low collections from Auburn and Alpine, the data presented and analyzed here in this repository pertains only to Mobile.**
